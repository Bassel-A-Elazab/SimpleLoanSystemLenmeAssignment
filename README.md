First:
  I created a borrower module that handle all borrower operation such that :-
  
    add new borrower.         `     [url]("")
    update an existing borrower.    [url]("")
    read borrower informations.     [url]("")
    delete an existing borrower.    [url]("")
  
 The same operations above is created for investors.
    
    add new investor.         `     [url]("")
    update an existing investor.    [url]("")
    read investor informations.     [url]("")
    delete an existing investor.    [url]("")

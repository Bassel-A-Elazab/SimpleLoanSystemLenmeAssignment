First:
  I created a borrower module that handle all borrower operation such that :-
  
    add new borrower.         `     [url]("")
    update an existing borrower.    [url]("")
    read borrower informations.     [url]("")
    delete an existing borrower.    [url]("")
  
 The same operations above is created for investors.
    
    add new investor.         `     [url]("")
    update an existing investor.    [url]("")
    read investor informations.     [url]("")
    delete an existing investor.    [url]("")

Second:
  I created my main api which is (loan operations whether are beloning to borrower or investor).
  The loan system is applying to all these features:-
      
      1 - A borrower request al loan (5000$)          
          [url]("")
          [I made the borrower request as general his can request any loan]
      2 - An investor can see all the borrower's loan requests before offer to pay for them.  
          [url]("")
      3 - An investor can make an offer to any borrower's loan request and will be wait until borrower accpet offer.  
          [url]("")
      4 - A borrower can see all investor's offer to his particular loan request and can be choose one of them.   
          [url]("")
      5 - A borrower can accept any offer from investor.
          [url]("")
      6 - The system api submitted the request after borrower accepted it, And creates scheduled to borrower for payement.
          [url]("")
      7 - The system api update each payment date for borrower until completed all payment.
          [url]("")
      8 - The system api completed the loan request until borrower complete all the payment, And return the money for investor.
          [url]("")
